# Electricity Consumption Analysis in Portugal

I completed a comprehensive analysis of electricity consumption data, utilizing various data preparation, visualization, clustering, and prediction techniques. Here's an overview of the project:

**Data Preparation:** I imported and cleaned the electricity consumption data, ensuring it had no missing values and converting it to the appropriate format. I also converted kilowatts (kW) to kilowatt-hours (kWh).

**Visualization:** I visualized the distribution of electricity consumption values and explored the minimum, mean, and maximum consumption for each customer. I also conducted trending analysis for the top three consumers.

**Clustering:** I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and employed K-Means and DBSCAN clustering techniques to group customers based on their consumption patterns.

**Prediction:** I developed prediction models using Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future electricity consumption for a specific customer cluster.

**Consumption Improvement:** I analyzed mean hourly consumption patterns for different customer clusters to identify potential opportunities for optimizing energy consumption.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, clustering, and time series prediction, with a focus on improving energy efficiency. It's a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
